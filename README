Lingua::Stem

 Provides word stemming algorithms localized by language.

Current only 'En' (English) is supported, but hooks for
other languages are in place. The next to be added 
will be 'De' (German).

Changes

 0.50 2000.09.14 - Fixed major implementation error. Starting with
                   version 0.30 I forgot to include rulesets 2,3 and 4
                   for Porter's algorithm. The resulting stemming results
                   were very poor. Thanks go to "Yap" <csyap@netfision.com>
                   for bringing the problem to my attention. Unfortunately,
                   the fix inherently generates *different*
                   stemming results than 0.30 and 0.40 did. If you
                   need identically broken output - use locale 'en-broken'.

 0.40 2000.08.25 - Added stem caching support as an option. This
                   can provide a large speedup to the operation
                   of the stemmer. Caching is default turned off
                   to maximize compatibility with previous versions.

 0.30 1999.06.24 - Replaced core of 'En' stemmers with code from
                   Jim Richardson <jimr@maths.usyd.edu.au>
                   Aliased 'en-us' and 'en-uk' to 'en'
                   Fixed 'SYNOPSIS' to correct return value
                   type for stemmed words (SYNOPIS error spotted 
                   by <Arved_37@chebucto.ns.ca>)

 0.20 1999.06.15 - Changed to '.pm' module, moved into Lingua:: namespace,
                   added OO interface, optionalized the export of routines 
                   into the caller's namespace, added named parameter
                   initialization, stemming exceptions, autoloaded
                   locale support and isolated case flattening to
                   localized stemmers prevent i18n problems later. 

                   Input and output text are assumed to be in UTF8
                   encoding (no operational impact right now, but
                   will be important when extending the module to
                   non-English).
